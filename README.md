**Bambhari_Ayurveda-Ayatanam** 🌿

A comprehensive web application dedicated to providing information and services related to Ayurveda practices.


**Overview**
This project is a multi-page website developed as a team effort (structured under Team C and Team D directories), utilizing modern web technologies to create an informative and responsive user experience. It covers various aspects of Ayurvedic treatments and consultations.


**Technologies Used 🛠️**
The project is built using the following core technologies and libraries:

HTML5 & CSS3: The foundational markup and styling languages.
JavaScript: Used for client-side interactivity and dynamic content.
Bootstrap v5.3.2: A robust front-end framework used extensively for responsive layouts, components, and utility classes.
Font Awesome: Integrated for scalable vector icons (v6.0.0 link observed).
Vercel: The platform used for deployment and hosting the live site.


**Technical Details**

Line Endings: The project currently uses LF line endings, but the Windows environment is configured to expect CRLF, which generates a standard Git warning upon git add operations.
Configuration: The project includes a .gitattributes file and potentially specific .vscode/settings.json files for consistent project configuration.
Mobile Optimization: The CSS includes @media (max-width: 991px) queries for specific mobile layout optimizations (e.g., using flex-direction: column for stack layouts).
